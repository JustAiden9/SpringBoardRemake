# SpringBoardRemake

This is an iOS app that makes a new home screen on top of the base home screen.
 - This works on all iOS versions 16-18+
 - This is a fun project I made with the limited knowledge I have of Swift.
 - The app opening feature should work if you have them installed from the app store or sideloaded them

Can I customize it?
 - Sort of... you have to edit the code to get it to what you want it to be because I am lazy.

How to download/eta?
 - Go to the releases and get the most up-to-date one!
